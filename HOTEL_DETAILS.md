## Historical Significance

### The San Roman Building Legacy (1850)
The architectural lineage of 1147 E. Levee Street traces back to the San Roman Building, established in 1850. During this foundational era for Brownsville, the building quickly became a focal point for the city's social and political life.

### Civil War Intelligence Operations (1860s)
During the American Civil War, the structure served a critical logistical and intelligence function. Known as a "librería" or bookstore, it provided a facade for intellectual exchange while its roof served as a vantage point for Union forces. During their occupation of Fort Brown, Union forces utilized the building's height to monitor activities across the Rio Grande in Matamoros, Mexico, literally pitching a tent on the roof to facilitate surveillance operations.

### 19th Century Social Hub
Throughout the latter half of the 19th century, the building functioned as:
- A "house of spirits" (saloon)
- A venue for public speeches delivered from its ornate balconies
- A site for high-society social events

The name "San Roman Bldg. 1850" remains visible today, etched below the denticulated cornice, serving as a permanent reminder of the building's deep-rooted connection to the city's origins.

### The 1915 Construction Phase
As Brownsville transitioned into the 20th century, the demand for sophisticated commercial and hospitality spaces grew. The current primary structure was largely defined by the 1915 construction phase, coinciding with:
- The arrival of the Missouri Pacific Railroad terminal
- The expansion of the city's commercial core
- The influx of merchants, travelers, and cultural pioneers to the Rio Grande Valley

The structure encompasses approximately **8,908 square feet**, featuring warm stucco, classic archways, and inviting corridors that honor the aesthetic traditions of the region.

### Modern Era Restoration (1987)
The 1987 restoration refined the building's features, ensuring modern safety and comfort standards without losing its vintage character.

### Historic Recognition
- **Contributing Property** in a Local Historic District
- Recognized by the Brownsville Historical Association
- Featured on heritage ghost tours due to its layered history and connections to the La Matanza era
